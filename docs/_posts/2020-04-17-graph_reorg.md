title:  "Web-site reorganisation"
categories: website

Even small amounts of data can generate many different types of graphs and results.
The number of graphs is becoming too much for a single page so I've made a major re-organisation of the web site.
Graphs are now organised into sub-categories and navigation is made easier.
The blog will still continue in parallel but the graphs sections will be expanded.

All of this using the [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/) templating language inside the Jekyll framework.
See the [git repo](https://github.com/paulknewton/covid-ml) for more details (especially the scipts in the [_bin folder](https://github.com/paulknewton/covid-ml/tree/master/docs/_bin)) and the [new markdown pages](https://github.com/paulknewton/covid-ml/blob/master/docs/totals.md).
