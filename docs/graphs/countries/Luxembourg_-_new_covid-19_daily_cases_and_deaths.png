Figures for Luxembourg show a very high infection rate as a percentage of the overall population. This is generally due to the figure being used as the population: the active working population is many times higher than the actual number of residents due to the high daily influx of frontier workers. These clearly impact infection rates but are not taken into account in the statistics.
