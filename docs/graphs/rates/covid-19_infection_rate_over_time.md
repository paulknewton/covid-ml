This graph plots the *infection rate* of the virus, that is, the number of cases as a percentage of the overall population. This allows some comparison between countries (larger countries tend to have higher infection numbers, simply due to the increased population).

These per-capita calculations can be misleading for countries that have particularly low populations e.g. Luxembourg, Switzerland. These countries typically have large numbers of active people from outside the national borders that work in the country (and therfore spread the virus). However, the difference between this *active population* and official population figures are not taken into account. This can give unusually high infection rates.

Note how the gradients of the curves - indicating the infection/mortality rates - vary across countries. For example, Italy and Spain have broadly similar numbers of infections, but when scaled as as fraction of the underyling populations, the Spanish infection rate is rather higher. Note also how the gradient of the curves differ: the infection was slower to take hold in Spanish (or at least, as reflected in the recorded figures), but quickly accelerated to match Italy.
