This metric calculates the proportion of deaths compared to the recorded cases. It describes the likelihood of a COVID-19 infection being fatal.

While this removes the bias against population sizes, the figures are still subject to the same issues relating from the recording of the raw data (levels of testing; classification of death as COVID-related etc). Unlike the Infection Fatality Rate, these graphs only use recorded cases and do not try to take account of undiagnosed cases.

* Many of the top countries are under-developed nations. This may indicate limitations in the health care systems (where a COVID infection has an increased risk of a fatality), and/or be a result of more limited testing programmes (which reduce the number of recorded infections).

* Some developed nations now appear in the list of countries with high CRR metrics (France, Belgium, UK, Italy). This often aligns with the high numbers of deaths being recorded. However, this can also be due to many other factors that do not necessarily indicate higher changes of COVID-related death. For example, France records deaths in both hospitals and care homes which result in higher death figures compared to other european countries. rate. Some nations have struggled to scale-up the levels of testing which can indirectly increase the CFR. Finally, while many European nations have been hit hard by the COVID virus, there are generally well-developed and stable methods for recording deaths compared to other countries.

* More generally, there is widespread agreement that the numbers of recorded infections is significantly lower than the actual infections. In these cases, the CFR metric should be treated with caution (currently over 5% worldwide). This is likely to be significantly higher than the real Infection Fatality Rate (which measures deaths as a fraction of the _actual_ numbers of infections).
