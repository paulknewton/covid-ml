Countries with larger populations appear higher in the lists simply as a result of the size.

Also, the statistics do not consider how the levels of testing vary across countries. There appears to be a significant difference across countries which directly affects the numbers of recorded cases. This can be due to many reasons:

* Differences in government policy: some countries placed increased importance on widespread testing in order to isolate carriers and to better understand the spread within the population
* Availability of testing: some countries have been able to use national manufacturing capacity to make tests available while other countries have found this more difficult.
* Prioritisation: many countries focus testing on patients with severe symptoms. Many patients have either mild symptoms or are asymptomatic so are not tested.

Some estimates indicate that only 3% of populations are being tested for COVID-19 which would suggest a significant number of undetected infections.
