This graphs shows those countries with the highest _infection rate_, that is, the number of recorded COVID-19 cases as a percentage of the overall population.

As noted previously, testing policies vary widely across countries which makes comparisons difficult. However, expressing figures per capita does allow some kind of comparison.

Note that countries with the highest infection rates are often those with very small populations. These countries may have small official populations (residents) but higher numbers of border workers and other people passing through the country. This increases the number potential carriers with a corresponding increase in the number of COVID cases.
