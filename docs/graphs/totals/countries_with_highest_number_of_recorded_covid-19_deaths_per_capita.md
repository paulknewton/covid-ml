This graphs shows countries with the highest mortality rates (per 1000 people). While many of the hotspot countries (Italy, Spain) are still present, some of the larger countries no longer appear in the graphs (notably USA: while the recorded infections are far higher than any other countries, this is still lower when population size is taken into consideration).

As before, differences in testing policies and recording deaths will skew the statistics. Countries with particularly small populations can also appear disproportionately (e.g. San Marino, Luxembourg, Guernsey, Monaco). This may be due to statistical margins of errors, or may indicate that the official populations do not accurately reflect the numbers of active people in the country (e.g. large numbers of frontier workes travelling across borders can significantly increase the intra-day population).
