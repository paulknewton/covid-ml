These countries have recorded COVID-19 infections but are yet to register any COVID-19 deaths.

This does not necessarily indicate highly effective COVID treatments. Some countries may not be capturing COVID-related deaths in the statistics. For example, a common pattern with countries that are in the early stages of COVID infection are that COVID deaths are not recognised as such and go unrecorded. Only when the numbers increase do countries accept that they are succumbing to the virus and start to test explicitly for the virus in any post-mortem.
