This graph plots COVID-19 infections over time for some selected countries. Notice how the curves generally follow an S-shape, starting slowing then increasing exponentially as the virus takes hold in the population. As the virus works its way through the population, it runs out of carriers and the spread starts to slow. This results in a flattening of the curve.

The graph plots infections on a linear y-axis. The gradient of the curve shows the rate of increase in new infections. The United States of America has seen a sharp infection curve that reflects the very high number of COVID cases. While the more affected european countries do differ in overall infections, the infection curves are comparable.

Note how Austria has a very low infection curve. Austria is generally seen as having acted early and decisively, resulting a early containment of the virus.
