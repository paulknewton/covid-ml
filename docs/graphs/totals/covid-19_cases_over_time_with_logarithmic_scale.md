The [default infections graph](#Covid-19 Cases Over Time) plots cases over time using a linear y-scale. Countries with large populations typically have large numbers of COVID infections, with corresponding sharp infection curves.

However, a linear plot can be misleading. Countries such as the US have experienced very high numbers of COVID cases, yet this is partly to be expected due to the large population of the country. We know that virus generally spread exponentially as each carrier infect multiple new hosts - who then infect multiple others, and so on.

A logarithmic scale is a more natural representation of virus growth, as it captures the exponential nature of infection. This allows infection curves of different countries to be visualised side-by-side. With this scaling, most of the countries are following similar infection trajectories.
